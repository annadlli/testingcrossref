```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r uniquename, fig.cap = "Number of illnesses in the past two weeks, based on the 1977--1978 Australian Health Survey", echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(AER)

data("DoctorVisits", package = "AER")

DoctorVisits |>
  ggplot(aes(x = illness)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")
```

For instance, (Figure \@ref(fig:uniquename)) will produce: (Figure 4.4) as the name of the R chunk is uniquename. We also need to add ‘fig’ in front of the chunk name so that R Markdown knows that this is a figure. We then include a ‘fig.cap’ in the R chunk that specifies a caption.
